# S1_MCU_Script_modified
Modified Mackie Control script for Studio One to (slightly) improve Avid Artist mix functionality. 

This improves the oled displays on the Avid Artist Mix when using them in Mackie Control mode in Studio One. The default script doesn't allow you to see the track volume when adjusting the fader, and the pan setting is also messed up. This makes it a bit more useable. 

To install, copy and replace files in the directory - /Applications/Studio One 4.app/Contents/devices/Mackie/Control
